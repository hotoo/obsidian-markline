### Header

### Meta

Between title and group or lines, we can set meta data in markdown by key-value pair.

```markdown
# title

- age: show
- date: 2014/01/01
- author: @hotoo
- mention: https://twitter.com/{@mention}

----

# Group 1

* 2014 line 1.
```

Now we support meta data:

* `age`: show age after year in top header line. default is hide, if want show, set:

  ```markdown
  - age: show
  ```
* `mention`: set mention enable, and mention base url. default mention is disable.

  ```md
  # @Mention Demo

  - mention: https://github.com/{@mention}

  ----

  - 2014 @hotoo mention @lizzie
  ```

  `{@mention}` is placeholder for mention name.

* `hashtag`: custom hashtag styles.

  ```md
  # #HashTag Demo

  - hashtag:
    - tag-name: text-color, background-color
    - life: yellow, #f00
    - job: rgb(255,255,255), rgba(255,0,0,0.5)
